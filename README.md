> **NOTAM** actually stands for **Notice To Airmen** and is the primary means of disseminating all kinds of information to pilots. Some of this information can be of critical importance.

> This system has gone through very few changes since its invention in the 1920s, even though the number of airports and airplanes that operate have increased exponentially over the years. 

> This project aims at simplifying the process of publishing and accessing a NOTAM as well as attempts to simplify the information presentation for quicker understanding.

> This project does not require any proprietary API or product.
